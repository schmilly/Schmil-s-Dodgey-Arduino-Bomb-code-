NOT REAL BOMB CODE essentially code for arduino that counts down from 9 with a 7 segment display. 

Essentially, if you hookup up wires to set led, which each represents a segment of the display (i.e. bottom is bottom of 7 segment display, bottom left is left side of bottom half, bottom right is right side of e.t.c.) and haven't messed up electronics, it will slowly count down to 0, where once reached will flash twice. I think I made this puerly as a funny little christmas exchange joke thing a few years back (2019)

Not sure it will be any help to anyone but I think its cool :)
